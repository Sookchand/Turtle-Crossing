#  Turtle Crossing {Python Game}
Your game is called Turtle Crossing, and it is a fun and challenging game that simulates a turtle trying to cross the road. The game consists of a turtle, a car manager, and a scoreboard. The goal of the game is to help the turtle reach the finish line without colliding with the cars. The game becomes harder as the level increases and the cars move faster.

To play the game, you need to use the keyboard to control the turtle. You can use the Up arrow key to move the turtle up by 10 units. You need to avoid the cars that are randomly generated and move from right to left. If the turtle hits a car, the game is over and a message is displayed. If the turtle reaches the top edge of the screen, the turtle returns to the starting position and the level and the score are increased.

The game is written in Python, using the turtle module to create the graphics and the events. The game code is divided into several files, each containing a class that defines the behavior and attributes of the game objects. The main.py file is the main script that runs the game loop and imports the other files. The player.py file contains the Player class that creates and moves the turtle. The car_manager.py file contains the CarManager class that creates and moves the cars, and handles the level up. The scoreboard.py file contains the Scoreboard class that displays and updates the score, and the game over message.

## Tech Stack
The game was created using the following technologies:

â€¢  Python: This is a popular and versatile programming language that has many modules and libraries for various functionalities and features. Python was used to write the main script and the custom modules for the game objects.

â€¢  Turtle: This is a built-in module in Python that allows drawing graphics and animations using turtle objects. Turtle was used to create and manage the screen, the turtle, the cars, and the scoreboard.

â€¢  Time: This is a built-in module in Python that provides functions for working with time and dates. Time was used to control the game speed by pausing the execution for a certain amount of time.

â€¢  Keyboard events: These are functions from the turtle module that allow binding keyboard keys to turtle methods. Keyboard events were used to handle the user input and the turtle movements.




## Documentation
Here are the links to the official web pages for each technology:

â€¢  Python: This is the official documentation for Python 3.12.0, which covers the language reference, the library reference, the tutorials, and more.https://www.python.org/doc/

â€¢  Turtle: This is the official documentation for the turtle module, which provides turtle graphics primitives, in both object-oriented and procedure-oriented ways.https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html

â€¢  Time: This is the official documentation for the time module, which provides various time-related functions, such as getting the current time, sleeping for a certain amount of time, and formatting time values.https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html

â€¢  Keyboard events: These are the functions from the turtle module that allow binding keyboard keys to turtle methods, such as onkey () and listen ().
## Lessons Learned
Some of the lessons that can be learned by creating Pong are:
â€¢  How to use object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python, which is a paradigm that organizes data and behavior into classes and objects. OOP can help you create modular, reusable, and maintainable code for complex projects.https://realpython.com/tutorials/gamedev/https://gamedevacademy.org/python-oop-tutorial/https://blog.jetbrains.com/education/2021/12/07/learn-in-1-hour-object-oriented-programming-in-python/

â€¢  How to define classes and objects in Python, which are the core components of OOP. Classes are blueprints that specify the attributes and methods of a type of object. Objects are instances of classes that have specific values and behaviors. You can use the class keyword and the __init__ method to create classes and objects in Python.https://realpython.com/tutorials/gamedev/https://gamedevacademy.org/python-oop-tutorial/https://blog.jetbrains.com/education/2021/12/07/learn-in-1-hour-object-oriented-programming-in-python/

â€¢  How to use inheritance and polymorphism in Python, which are key features of OOP. Inheritance allows you to create subclasses that inherit the attributes and methods of a parent class, and add or override them as needed. Polymorphism allows you to use the same method name for different types of objects, and execute different behaviors depending on the object type. You can use the super function and the isinstance function to implement inheritance and polymorphism in Python.https://realpython.com/tutorials/gamedev/https://gamedevacademy.org/python-oop-tutorial/https://blog.jetbrains.com/education/2021/12/07/learn-in-1-hour-object-oriented-programming-in-python/

â€¢  How to use encapsulation and abstraction in Python, which are important principles of OOP. Encapsulation means hiding the internal details of an object from the outside world, and providing a public interface to interact with the object. Abstraction means simplifying the complexity of an object by focusing on its essential features and functionality. You can use the self keyword and the underscore prefix to implement encapsulation and abstraction in Python.https://realpython.com/tutorials/gamedev/https://gamedevacademy.org/python-oop-tutorial/https://blog.jetbrains.com/education/2021/12/07/learn-in-1-hour-object-oriented-programming-in-python/

â€¢  How to use the turtle module in Python, which is a built-in library that allows you to create graphics and animations using turtle objects. The turtle module can help you create simple and fun games with minimal code. You can use the Screen class, the Turtle class, and the onkey function to create and manage the screen, the game objects, and the keyboard events.https://realpython.com/tutorials/gamedev/https://g
